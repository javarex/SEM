Scholar Evaluation Metric (SEM)

The Scholar Evaluation Metric (SEM) is a structured assessment framework designed to evaluate scholarship candidates based on three key dimensions:

- Emotional Quotient (EQ): Measures emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills, and resilience.
- Intelligence Quotient (IQ): Assesses cognitive abilities, problem-solving skills, and academic aptitude.
- Socio-Economic Form (SE): Evaluates financial background and socio-economic challenges to ensure fair opportunities.

Purpose: SEM provides a standardized, objective, and holistic approach to scholarship selection by integrating these three dimensions into a single scoring system. It ensures that candidates are not just academically gifted but also emotionally intelligent and socio-economically deserving.

How It Works:

- Each criterion is assigned a weighted score based on its importance in the selection process.
- Panelists score candidates on predefined indicators within each category.
- The final SEM Score (0-100 or any preferred scale) determines eligibility and ranking.
